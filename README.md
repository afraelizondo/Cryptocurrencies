# Unsupervised Machine Learning in Cryptocurrencies

Unsupervised Machine Learning is used when there is no known output so the model uses a whole dataset as input. It is performed to discover patterns or groups in data.

 Unsupervised learning is used when we don't yet know the question we're asking of the data. In other words, we just want to figure out if there is anything at all the data can tell us.

It is used in one of the following two ways:

- Transform the data to create an intuitive representation for analysis or to use in another machine learning model.

- Cluster or determine patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification.

The following steps are necessary for preparing data:

1. Data selection; making good choices about which data will be used.
2. Data processing; organizing the data by formatting, cleaning, and sampling it.
3. Data transformation; transforming our data into a simpler format for storage and future use.

This project is based on a cryptocurrencies dataset, to convince Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank to invest in this cutting-edge financial system, so it can offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. 

Since we decided to use clustering algorithm to parse data to help us make decisions, there are two ways to perform the unsupervised learning:

1. K-means algorithm; it groups the data into K clusters, where belonging to a cluster is based on some similarity or distance measure to a centroid. A centroid is a data point that is the arithmetic mean position of all the points on a cluster.

2. Hierarchical clustering, also known as agglomerative clustering, works with groups (clusters) of data points. The algorithm starts by declaring each point with its own cluster, then merges the two most similar clusters until a declared stopping point has been reached.
